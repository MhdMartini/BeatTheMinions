# BeatTheMinions
Play with your friends against the Boss and his Minions!

- The game starts by asking the user how many players they wish to start with. 
  Each player then gets to make a move against the Boss and his Minions. These moves are:
  1. Attack: Opponent loses HP equal to the attackers attack level minus the opponent defense level 
  2. Charge: Increases the attack level of the charged player. Not stackable.
  3. Shield: protects the player from the next three attacks. Not stackable.

- At the beginning of each round, the Boss spawns a Minion. Each Minion has 1/4 the Boss's MAX HP

- The Boss's MAX HP is 20 times the number of players.
  . If a player wants to attack, they get a list of available Minions they choose from
  . Minons always attack the player created last

- If all Minions die, players can attack the Boss.

- The game ends if either the Boss dies, or all players die.
